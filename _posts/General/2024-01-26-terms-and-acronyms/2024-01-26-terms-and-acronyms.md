### Apps, Exploits, Softmods:

**FMCB** = *"Free MemoryCard Boot"* -->
- This is the most commonly used exploit/Softmod used on a vast variety of models.
- It is being installed on the MemoryCard.
- Works on SCPH-10000 to SCPH-90xxx.
- Some 90k have BOOT-ROM 2.30 however and won't automatically boot FMCB.

**FHDB** = *"Free HardDrive/HardDisk Boot"* -->
- internal storage/HDD variation of FMCB for FAT PS2s as well as 70k-Slim PS2s!
- It is installed onto the internal HDD.
- Works on 10k to 70k!
-  70k need FMCB to boot FHDB.

**OpenTuna** --> A MemoryCard Exploit for the newest PS2-Model (SCPH-90k, with a BOOT-ROM version of 2.30) or PS2-models as well as MemoryCards which are not working with MagicGate.


### Devices:

**MC** = *"MemoryCard"*

**HDD** = *"Harddisk Drive"* and this ALWAYS means INTERNAL HDD!!!

**USB** = *any storage-device connected via USB, regardless if it is a HDD, Flash/pendrive, SSD, SD, etc.*
You call a USB HDD "HDD" in our scene? You do it WRONG! It is **"USB"**!

**MX4SIO** = *SD connected via MC-Port*

**i.Link/FireWire/s400** = Firewire etc., only available up to 39k!

**LAN** = SMB, UDPBD, etc., available on EVERY PS2!


### Other things:

**BOOT-ROM** = *often falsely referred to as "BIOS"*
- This is the software/firmware the PS2 comes shipped with!
- It is NOT rewriteable in itself!
